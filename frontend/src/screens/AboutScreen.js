          Waiting in lines in front of food trucks is a common experience for Columbia students,
          and not surprisingly, same thing is happening for many other universities and companies!
          Sometimes it will take even more than 30 minutes to get lunch, because apart form the
          time spent waiting in line, waiting for cooking can also be extremely slow. Waiting
          itself is already frustrating, not to mention if we have to wait in cold, rainy, windy
          or snowy days!

          Of course, we do have some other options, but they are far from ideal as well. If we
          bring our own lunch to university, by the time for lunch it will be as cold as stone.
          Moreover, not everyone is skillful and patient enough for cooking! Alternatively we can
          order food online or by phone and hope it will arrive just in time. However, this is
          just nearly never the case. I believe you must have similar experience: you have to
          answer a phone call in the middle of a class or meeting telling you your food has
          arrived. Or you waited hungrily for 15 minutes until the delivery finally called you.
          Why don’t we have a more reliable choice? A choice that can keep you away from
          waiting as well as keep your lunch hot?

          These are the motivation of our solution: smart food delivery! When people can fetch their lunch
          from our smart food delivery boxes, problem can thus be solved. Moreover, the hygiene and
          security condition outside campus will be improved as well, without so many people jamming in
          front of food trucks!

        <span>OUR COMMITMENT</span>
        <p>
          We believe that delivering a stable supply of safe, delicious food is the key mission of the
          FoodHub.

          The FoodHub regards food safety as the top management priority. This is because we believe it is
          more important than anything that the food ingredients customers eat not only taste delicious but
          can be enjoyed with peace of mind. This is why FoodHub established the Group Food Safety Pursuing
          Division, which conducts daily on-site research and inspections in all processes from procurement
          through the provision of services, to ensure food safety.
